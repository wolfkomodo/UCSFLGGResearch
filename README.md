# UCSFLGGResearch

This is a research project I did with UCSF in high school studying the use of machine learning to predict the incidence of diabetes insipidus as a post-operative complication in patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas. I presented this work at my local science fair.

Here is a link for an writeup that describes the work and some of my results. Excuse the poor formatting â€” I didn't know what LaTeX was in high school: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mSeXPiIxlEEV6VdRKqwRhmE-YK6R56-X/view?usp=sharing
